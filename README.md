# T3-DDW-1D
Supervised Machine Learning - Multiple Linear Regression Model w/ Python 
This was an introductory supervised machine learning module I took in term 3 of being in SUTD. This project aims to predict the largest contributing factor in wheat yield to better allocate resources. This project is solely done in python, with the help of numpy and pandas libraries. SKlearn is only used to cross-validate our test results but is not used to predict.

Here's an [example of the code](SC04_DDW_2D_Group_1.md) I've written for this machine learning project.

Background:
Food insecurity has been steadily rising since 2014. Between 2018 and 2019, the number of hungry people grew by 10 million people. Most of the increase in food security comes from Asia, where the majority of the undernourished people live. Hence, our group's target demographic is the Asian region. Our group chose to focus on Wheat since it is a staple food that is essential to many in Asia. Furthermore, Asia is the largest producer of wheat. The FAO states that one possible solution to tackling the rising food insecurity is to reduce the cost of food. Through demand and supply, when the supply of a good increases, prices should fall. Hence, our group has decided to focus on increasing the crop yield of wheat to keep prices affordable to tackle food insecurity. To increase the yield of wheat, we first have to predict the yield of wheat. The prediction of crop yield is based on soil, meteorological, environmental, macro economic and crop parameters. After building our model, we will be able to determine the predictor that affects the yield of wheat most significantly. In turn, countries in Asia will be able to better allocate their resources into that identified factor and increase the yield of wheat, in hopes of tackling food insecurity.

User persona:
Our target demographic will be the undernourished and people who face food insecurity in Asia.

Problem statement: How might we identify the largest contributing factor to a country's wheat yield, in order to prioritise allocation of resources towards that contributing factor to increase wheat output.
